#pico680b-mikbug09subset-tester<BR>
picobug is bellow.<BR>
https://github.com/simple-circuit/picobug<BR>
(Altair 680b simulator with prom monitor)<BR>

I try several times to make mikbug and minibug work on picobug.<BR>
But I did not complete because picobug's ino's Stack frame was not same with swtpc or mikbug 's one.<BR>
So this made for testing mikbug's routines on picobug memory.<BR>
<BR><PRE>
How to use
1. L on picobug
2. send mikb09.s19 via teraterm of your terminal.
3. J 0300
4. Then * prompts.
5. Available Commands: L(G has not yet, so not well tested), M, R

Enjoy!<BR>
