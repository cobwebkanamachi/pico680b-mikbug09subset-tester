#pico680b-mikbug09subset-tester
picobug is bellow.

(Altair 680b simulator with prom monitor)

I try several times to make mikbug and minibug work on picobug.
But I did not complete because picobug's ino's Stack frame was not same with swtpc or mikbug 's one.
So this made for testing mikbug's routines on picobug memory.

How to use
1. L on picobug
2. send mikb09.s19 via teraterm of your terminal.
3. J 0300
4. Then * prompts.
5. Available Commands: L(G has not yet, so not well tested), M, R

Enjoy!
